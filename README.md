Final project for my College course
It is a windows form software that is a prototype for a Zoo booking service
Users are able to access a wide range of articles, both educational and leisurely

It includes a backend and frontend, because this is a prototype the database is stored locally and as a result
the security of this project is low, but I believe the overall quality of code is high and their are some
security practices in play, like password hashing

For my college course, upon reviewing the code base, please look at this form

There is a demonstration video linked in the second half of the form if you dont want to download this
repo and try it out yourself :)
